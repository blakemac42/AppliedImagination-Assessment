-This was a fun little project to work on, I appreciate for the opportunity. 

-You can find the relevant filter functionality between the <script> tags at the bottom of the index.html page.

-Page was built to be best viewed on desktop at 1200px and down to a media window stopping at 300px 

-Responsive styles were mostly made via adjusting my browser window. Also tested with the edge browser inspect tool. Edge restricts window shrinking once you hit 500px width. Font sizes seemed to warp when viewed via shrinking the window in web inspect, but displayed just fine when shrinking the native window myself. Since I cant run the local python server on my phone I mostly went with how the browser nativly displays the fonts. Otherwise the constant morphing font sizes would prove to be a headache during the responsive development.
