-This was a fun little project to work on, I appreciate for the opportunity. 

-I was plagued with CORS errors when trying to make ajax calls to a local .JSON file. My solution to this was to have it served from a local python server instead. Apologies for the extra testing steps, but to see the filter in action all you need to do is to go into the command line, navigate to the project directory and run:
'python -m http.server 8000' 
If you have an older version of python it will likely be:
'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'

-You can find the relevant filter functionality between the <script> tags at the bottom of the index.html page.

-Page was built to be best viewed on desktop at 1200px and down to a media window stopping at 300px 

-Responsive styles were mostly made via adjusting my browser window. Also tested with the edge browser inspect tool. Edge restricts window shrinking once you hit 500px width. Font sizes seemed to warp when viewed via shrinking the window in web inspect, but displayed just fine when shrinking the native window myself. Since I cant run the local python server on my phone I mostly went with how the browser nativly displays the fonts. Otherwise the constant morphing font sizes would prove to be a headache during the responsive development.
